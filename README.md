# MakieExtra.jl

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Extra features for `Makie.jl`: plot recipes, scales, ticks, ... .

The included features that are either not fleshed out enough to be included into `Makie` itself, or can only be implemented with some "hacks" at the current moment. Still, they are generally useful, and `MakieExtra.jl` exists to make them available for use in both scripts and packages.

Everyone is welcome to suggest new features and convenience utilities to include into `MakieExtra`! This package aims to have a lower entry barrier than `Makie` itself.
